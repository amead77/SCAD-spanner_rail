Spanner Rail/Organiser for a tool chest.

I didn't like the spanner rail options that was already out there.
Mostly you couldn't make changes easily, just select between some pre modelled stl files.
This is an OpenSCAD model that is fully adjustable.
You can have 1 single spanner or a trillion, though I think your computer will run out of ram before calculating that, plus the printer might not like it.
Public domain, do as you wish. Though if you do mod it, I'd be interested to see the code mode.
